# REFLECTIONS

From this industrial talk, I have learnt about the various job types that are available in the IT sector and what they do in their positions.
I also learnt about the tools that they utilise to perform their tasks and the skills required to excel at their jobs. This gave me an early exposure and idea on what I want to do after finishing my studies and entering industry. It also made me realise that I should learn more skills and prepare myself mentally so that I am ready to work in the industry in the future.
